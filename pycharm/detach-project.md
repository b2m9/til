# Detach folder from Project view

When handling multiple projects PyCharm, it may happen that unwanted projects get
added to the `Project Panel`. PyCharm will remember all attached projects and will
reopen them when the root project is opened.

To detach unwanted projects form the panel:

- Select the project
- Press `Delete`
